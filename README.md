# Collaborative TradingView Indicator (MPL 2.0)

This repository is a fully open-source Pine Script project built on **v6** under the **Mozilla Public License 2.0**. The goal is to build a high-quality, community-vetted indicator by following best practices and modular design.

## üöÄ Current Status
The script, found in `CTI_v1.pine`, currently plots a **20-period Simple Moving Average** as a baseline. The core structure is ready for feature additions and logic implementation.

1.  **Feature Development:** Integrate new core logic (e.g., adding **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** or **Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**).
2.  **Code Review & Optimization:** Review the Pine Script code for efficiency, best practices, and runtime performance.
3.  **Documentation:** Help create detailed usage guides, backtesting reports, and clearer comments.
